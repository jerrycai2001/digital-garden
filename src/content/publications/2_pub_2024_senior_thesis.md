### Abstract  
Nearly one million U.S. patients suffer from movement disorders that may require awake brain surgery. Accurate tracking of upper-limb motion with optical sensors is critical, yet difficult in the cluttered operating-room environment. This thesis compares positional-error profiles across sensor configurations and experimental conditions (tracker mode, arm velocity, tremor). Results show that combining disparate sensors amplifies error, while lower limb-velocity and absence of tremor yield the highest accuracy—insights that inform intra-operative behavioral studies and future system design.
