#### Project Overview  
- **Goal :** Determine how different optical-sensor setups and movement parameters influence positional accuracy in the operating room.  
- **Key Findings :** Mixed-sensor rigs introduce >2× error; velocities < 0.4 m s⁻¹ and negligible tremor keep mean error < 1 mm.  
- **Impact :** Provides surgeons and neuro-engineers evidence-based guidelines for configuring trackers in awake DBS and similar procedures.
