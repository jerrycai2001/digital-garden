#### Project Overview

  - Drove **10+ inbound restaurant pilots** via cold-call demos of the voice agent.  
- **Product Milestones :**  
  - Built MVP reservation agent using **VAPI + OpenAI**; closed‐loop flow from phone inquiry → seat allocation → Stripe payment.

- **Operational Impact :**  
  - Orchestrated **10+ large-scale events** (live music, themed dinners) across NYC, coordinating venues, artists, sponsors, and logistics.  
  - Processed **$600 K+ GMV** despite funding constraints; kept CAC \< \$2 via organic content loops.  
- **Scale :** Optimized GTM toward high-traction user cohorts, growing the platform to **50 K+ registered users** by mid-2024.
