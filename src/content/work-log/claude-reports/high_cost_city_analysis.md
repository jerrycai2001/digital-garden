## Bottom Line Recommendation

**The Committee's Consensus**: 

**Cathie Wood**: "The network effects in SF alone could accelerate your career by 3-5 years. That's worth the higher costs."

**Charlie Munger**: "But don't let the high costs become permanent lifestyle inflation. Maintain your NC spending discipline."

**Ray Dalio**: "Consider a 2-3 year focused sprint in a high-cost city, then geographic arbitrage with your elevated income and network."

**Optimal Strategy**: 
- **Move to SF/LA/Boston for 2-3 years** during Horizon 1
- **Build network and advance career aggressively**
- **Maintain disciplined spending relative to income**
- **Consider relocating to lower-cost area** once network and income are established

This allows you to capture the career acceleration benefits while avoiding the long-term wealth drag of permanently high living costs.
