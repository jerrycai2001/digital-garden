imperfect execution beats waiting for perfection. 
persistence and mindful repetitions. 

if you fall short, keep on iterating. keep going and find the way. 

# todo
morning routine - yoga - yogurt
daily journaling

PZ - loan

meal prep



# meditations
The part people miss is if you fall short, even if you try your hardest and you still fall short, is that you still get up and try one more time. If it matters that much, then you will always get back up and try one more time. 

 people get caught up and waste time blaming themselves, feeling bad when the real path is acceptance, reflection, and then action. action can be the best form of reflection.
