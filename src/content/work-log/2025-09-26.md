obj: focused output, let energy flow through relationships

perhaps the wealth mechanism is embracing your core nature
not adhering and fitting into the conventional path
if assymetric dominance is brought by unconventional approaches
then embrace and fully embody my uniqueness

even applying to startup job positions, i'm not getting interviews
applying to "startups" who value uniqueness, tech jobs
which i have proof and experience to back up
applications are not converting - im trying so hard to land these 
entry-junior level positons at tech firms. 
feels like waste of energy and too much resistance.

"become a non-fungible individual"
such advice resonates deeply, 
relate with others know connect with your unique value proposition

more practically, what does this mean?
the fundamental assymetric advantage i have is being a coach, advisor, consultant. 
position myself as an expert in living a fully embodied, integrated life. 
for executives, tech entrepreneurs, artists - to reach their full LIFE potential. 
this means health, wealth and knowledge.

health being exercise, nutrition, daily routines, biorhythms
wealth being finances, budgeting, prioritizing, retirement planning
knowledge being cultural, art, history, philosophy, leisure pursuits. 

how can i help people live the life they were meant to live, not what others/society wants?

i must do so myself. adhere to these principles, and serve as an example. 

credentialism shouldn't be my primary focus. execution, getting results are. 
neither should obsessing over money. money should arrive naturally. 
focus on creating value, through execution and harnessing my 0.01% assymetric strengths, abilities. 

cut out noise from venture capital ecosystem. 
their priorities are fundamentally different than yours. 
don't get distracted by them or other tech founders. 
you are building a fundamentally different system. 
an embedded mesh of ALIGNMENT
with layers of human relationships
enabled by AI/tech workflows and advancement.
