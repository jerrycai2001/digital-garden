## Meditations

### 1040 AM
Your default mode should be a meditative, present state.
No unnecessary cognitive tasks or processes. 
Preserve your attention.


### 0630 AM
Nodes in network attracts signal. 

My goal is to build enough wealth (ethically) to enable a lifestyle of unconventional freedom, so I can explore niche interests and shape my personal human-centric vision. 

I was questioning overarching, conventional principles:
- Spend 20s in city, work alongside world-class talent - push your limits/capabilities + build network
- I need corporate/tech employment to ensure employability in future
- I need to develop "technical" or "corporate" skills necessary to survive in corporate environment / pass the recruitment screening assessments.
- I need to save for retirement, build financially stable base
- I need to work on economically valuable problems or patriotic causes (insurance, fintech, national defense, ai hardware, etc...)

Conventional YC/SF startup dogma doesn't resonate deeply anymore. I see it more as a game, detached, need to generate $$$. I don't believe in grinding 80 hours (like andreas was bragging about 80hrs/week, 7 days) that intensity doesn't make sense to me. You'll burn out in 1-2 years. 

Build a foundation, sustainable skill base and work hyper-focused 40-hour work weeks.

Its all about finding people, activities, organizations and locations that have highest personally resonant signal. From my life experiences, these always feel the most natural, are energy efficient and optimized resistance, and usually propel you to the next stage of life. 

Attachment to unaligned/outdated notions such as pre-med, consulting/IB exit ops, building a VC-backed unicorn are all holding me back. Yes, they feel like breaking out of safety into danger zone, and certain career suicide - but breaking this illusion is absolutely necessary to shatter traditional paradigms and find my own path forward in life. 

So, when assessing Rikhardt's encouragement to work on B2B or andreas, saying "thats just how the world works" you need to make money - it is an incomplete picture. Yes, Rikhardt's ikigai and personal dharmic niche in this world is in B2B startups, raising money, etcs...

But Jerry Cai's dharmic niche and ikigai lies elsewhere. Trust yourself, your own experiences and gravitate towards deeply resonant signals.
