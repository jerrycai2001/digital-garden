## Meditations

### 9:00 AM
Wow - traffic on I-40 can be brutal. Im tired from execution last night. Going forward, most of flow state work should be done in morning/earlier. I need to protect my evenings for personal and decompress - which allows for better sleep. 

Today, I'm going to take a break from AWS, development stuff. 

I need to develop a long-term plan for finances. Develop a long term earning/savings plan

Doing the startup, the Lake Tahoe adventure/gap year put me into debt. They were valuable learning experiences, which would compound. 

### 1:42 PM
Realization - compounding in the long term matters more than where you start off. This is like a mathematical function, where the rate of growth is orders higher, and eventually it will overtake the other with greater initial conditions. I'm treating this time now rather than a handicap, instead as developing iteration velocity, velocity to learn, be agile, and find alignment. 

The compounding effects of the morning meditation, exercising every other day, going to the gym. I am starting to see more now. Additionally, not being on my phone and behold to the algorithm at home has yielded a lot more bandwidth. 

I also believe approachable talent is the best way to find align jobs. The dynamic which Richard I operated on was the best leads must be inbound, and they want you, where you have all the leverage. The way I build this inbound and greater signal is to be .1% at a certain domain or skill.

The guiding question now is, what can I do better than anyone else at the moment, and position myself in a way where I can do this into perpetuity, and people want this? I don't think this would be found by selling yourself to accompany and being simply an employee, but giving you more time and trials to figure out this niche. I need to find a niche I can absolutely dominate.

Keep on going, Jerry, the long-term financial upside of your habits right now in living below your means in developing these discipline skills will free you ultimately. Just keep on going.

Insight: I've already done majority of exploration in my 20s. I have moved beyond the juvenile/bachelors lifestyle of consumption. I now need to invest and compound. I want enough financial but more importantly time/schedule flexibility to travel, visit other countries and cultures. I want AUTONOMY and freedom, which is most important to me. Freedom to learn, travel, pursue different hobbies. I definitely want a family, and embrace more traditional family values. 

Remember, all of this is an illusion. Meaning and fulfillment in life is created from struggle, challenges and triumph.
