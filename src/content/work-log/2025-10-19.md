title: Discipline as internal consistency, wu-wei execution
date: 2025-10-19
---
# memo
discipline =/= suffering
discipline shouldn't force 
discipline shouldn't wear down over time

its an internal consistency, commitment to higher values
not an attachment to immediate methods. 

> obj: wu-wei execution, highest ROI strategic moves. energy conservation

start with relationships - grounded in principles and core beliefs. 
intentions matter more than actual words.
