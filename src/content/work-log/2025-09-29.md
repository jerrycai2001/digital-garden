focus on wealth management!!
- apply to jobs
- reach out to WM advisors
- learn about painpoints, why 

update: richard texted me asking for my consent to shut down Agorum. I realize that shutting down might make most sense - protects from costs/downside (taxes, $5000 venture lab debt), while website, codebase can still remain intact. trying to make an informed decision before confirming the shutdown

Im getting mixed signals on my career trajectory. I want to directly build generational wealth - but is raising money from investors in SF the most effective way?

Richard called me today, and said I need to get to SF ASAP. Investors are closing and the fastest way to get stable footing and into the ecosystem is to get investment. 

I am concerned, because theres concerns about the AI bubble bursting.

I still continue to bet on Richard, because he hasn't significantly let down on his promises. He's still paying installments, and offered to make introductions for me to meet people. 

I don't want to jump back into the startup fray, because I know founders don't pay themselves much. Its also and incredible amount of mental energy to launch another startup, and I'd rather ease into this

The economic prospects are tempting, but I'm torn between my individual needs. 

However, like today, Richard assuaged my fears of shutting down Agorum. From his experience, it would be straightforward for me to raise. I was concerned about my parents, because they want me to get a "job".

Ideally, I'd bootstrap an AI company with minimal VC involvement and generate $$ directly, become profitable from day-1. Its a hard, tough balance to strike if I were seeking investment.
