chaotic but constructive day yesterday, 
managed momentum well and drove through
recharge energy, money can always regenerate
but actions immortalize reputation

> obj: temper and channel energy into relationships, focus on the bigger picture

agents are literally embodying the intuition of domain experts
you're optimizing for the higher, connected pursuits

1% at "slow growing industry" or 10% at "high growth industry"
10% at neuroengineering with limited upside or 1% my own game with 1000x multiplier
or 0.01% at your own game?

dominate your own world and bend the world to your will.
