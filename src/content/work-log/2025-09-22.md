what's the point of all this life? 
meaning is found in the struggle, the unknown, the uncertainty. 
pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

obsession beats talent in the long run. 
believe in the vision. 
feel the lows, and ride the highs. 

operate intuitively, every detail matters. 
every ounce of energy invested towards the dream,
could be your last. 

make it count.

where do we go now?
you've gone all in
further than you've ever gone.

but only despair
seems to sing 
late into the night.

everything feels like a waste
squandered alternatives
nothing to show.

where is the next step?
sink back into coziness
or a step of faith?
