### 12:26 PM
Logically, during a bad job market - one must go forth and start prospecting for new opportunities. I don't think sending out hundreds of job applications will help you stand out. I need to lean into my older mentors and professional contacts. 

My parents think playing the probability rate with job applications will yield interviews. However, I don't think that would be the best strategy - my resume is more tailored for medicine/research. I need to demonstrate my understanding of doing contract work, leaning into my entrepreneurial sales prospecting skills. 

This is something 99% of most recent grads are not doing - they have not overcome this mental obstacle yet that they must become more entrepreneurial. Thinking different, not conforming, is the key differentiator in this AI-disrupted economy.

**AI-Human Thesis**

We need to bolster AI-human augmentation more tangibly, not just pay lip service. 

Software World
1. Independent Professionals
  - Empower autonomy, independent consultants
  - GenAI supercharges bizops/admin -> smaller teams -> independent

Physical World
2. Embodied AI 
  - Solving unprecedented physical problems (logistics, defense, biotech etc...)
  - AI supercharges humans to solve fundamental tech/engineering barriers

Metaphysical World
3. Human Trust
  - Human thriving depends on positive-sum, collaborative Interpersonal relationships
  - Analog, face-to-face
  - Disconnect from tech, off-grid, wilderness retreats
