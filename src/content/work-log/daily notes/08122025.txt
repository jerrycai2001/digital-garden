I am exploring building an agentic B2C solution for insurance agents to streamline their workflows. I talked to 2 already - Their painpoints are primarily context switching between answering generic questions on phone/email. They understand the value of talking with clients and maintaining the human touch, but desperately wish they could integrate this another way, besides inefficient pop-up emails or discussions. Concerns are how slow and Bureaucratic NCFB is adopting tech solutions.

I want to prototype a simple solution - perhaps a Trello integration or email automator. Using existing AI agent tools, how can I build a prototype to demo and get their feedback?

n8n: A flexible workflow automation tool that offers a visual drag-and-drop interface for building workflows and integrations with numerous services, including email and Trello. It supports connecting with various Large Language Models (LLMs) to power the agent's intelligence.

3. Develop the prototype
Integrate with email: Use the chosen platform's email integration to monitor incoming emails or trigger sending emails based on specific actions.
Integrate with Trello: Connect to your Trello boards and use actions to create cards, add descriptions, assign members, and move cards between lists.
Define agent logic: Use the platform's visual builder or scripting capabilities to define the agent's behavior. This could involve:

Can you tell me what Truebridge capital (based in Chapel Hill) investment strategy is investing in other GPs, specifically at A16Z, Sequoia and Founder's Fund? 

He's basically an institution-eque PE fund that serves the equivalent of an LP role when investing in these GPs at T1 vc firms. 

How is this strategy even more effective than other private equity? And he also founded the Midas List? 90% of VCs lose money, but it appears that top firms do well. Given that A16z/FF/Sequoia are selective about their cap table, how does Truebridge differentiate themselves?

I was talking to Robert Templeton, we both are Penn alums and have mutual friends in the Chapel Hill area (his wife grew up in Chapel Hill) and we're both connected to the Chapel Hill tennis club
