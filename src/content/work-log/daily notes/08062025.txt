## Meditations

### 9:00 AM
Wow - traffic on I-40 can be brutal. Im tired from execution last night. Going forward, most of flow state work should be done in morning/earlier. I need to protect my evenings for personal and decompress - which allows for better sleep. 

Today, I'm going to take a break from AWS, development stuff. 

I need to develop a long-term plan for finances. Develop a long term earning/savings plan

Doing the startup, the Lake Tahoe adventure/gap year put me into debt. They were valuable learning experiences, which would compound. 

## Workspace

Insight: I've already done majority of exploration in my 20s. I have moved beyond the juvenile/bachelors lifestyle of consumption. I now need to invest and compound. I want enough financial but more importantly time/schedule flexibility to travel, visit other countries and cultures. I want AUTONOMY and freedom, which is most important to me. Freedom to learn, travel, pursue different hobbies. I definitely want a family, and embrace more traditional family values. 

Remember, all of this is an illusion. Meaning and fulfillment in life is created from struggle, challenges and triumph. 

Investments
- Stocks/Equities
- Real Estate Properties

Real Estate
- Consider buying land, developing my own properties. 
- Buy 2-3 small "cottages" or condos around the country and world that allows me to travel to ski, natural destinations

Economic Skills
- Leverage AI/Cloud technology - make money, invest and build stability

Social Capital
- Network with aligned technologists, innovators fascinated with human causes, natural and hardtech companies solving "real problems"

Retire 
- New England (summer home)
- Idaho/Montana ( ) 
- California - mediterranean climate

I can live retirement more modestly. Most likely, retiring in New England   offers geographic proximity to New York, Boston. 

> Do I buy 2 smaller properties across different states as investments?

Maybe even retire abroad in a spanish speaking country, like Spain or Portugal with mediterrranean climate.

## Workspace

What I've realized is long-term habits will pay dividends. Even with lower initial salary. We need to save
