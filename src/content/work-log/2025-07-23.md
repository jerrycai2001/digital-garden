## Meditations

### 8:18 AM

Nudge startup is now on my mind. I see this more as a transition ramp and leverage point to relocate to SF and go from there. I'm not going to be too attached, just proactively message a connection and see where it goes.

1) Get stable job and runway
2) Leverage opportunity for hardware build experience
3) Expand network in SF to more niche companies

**Realization:** when people look at my LinkedIn profile, or my résumé and Get hub, they probably see a scattered mind, jumping between different projects in different domains without a clear direction. Consolidate this into a focus vision that spans across domains

I was just thinking, if Shinkei, or if nudge people were looking at my résumé, it wouldn't be as powerful as it can be just based off of how it's framed. Looking at my current website, it seems Zhen and arts focused, rather than for Neuroscience, and more comprehensive systems integrator.

> [ ] figure out personal narrative
> [ ] write documentation for previous projects
- Senior thesis
- AR Research
- Social connectedness
> [ ] I need to redo my personal website, send in app before end of today

#### Key themes:

**One-liner:** a dynamic systems architect integrating engineering, human perception and biology. understanding the human condition through engineering, neuroscience and technology

- Brain Computer Interfaces
- Consumer apps for events/creators
- Mixed Reality Sensors

understanding the physical world through human perception, neuroscience and embodied experience

- Outdoor endeavors - skiing, fishing, photography
- Transcendental Meditation and Flow State
- Music, Food and Cultural exploration

understanding complex systems within biology and human structures.

- Biofabrication and semiotics
- Sustainable capitalism

What does this even mean? It doesn't align with obsession with specific domain. It is a fascination with a characteristic fundamental in multiple domains.

---

This is just a game or simulation. Don't get attached to other people's path prestige. Do I ACTUALLY desire to have a powerful network, large influence? would I ACTUALLY be fulfilled having built a massive company, developing cutting edge technology, having glory and fame associated with my name?

Or have the freedom, flexibility to travel the world, synthesize knowledge, discover, create with freedom. Artistic, cultural pursuits which create richness in life.

Or a peaceful, aligned life that allows maximal creation in my own niche?

I don't need to play the prestige/startup/influence-maxing game. This will emerge itself. Focus on my locus of control, my inner signal, energizing activities, creation and exploration.

---

My goal is to create freedom and stability, so I can pursue cool projects. That path to freedom and stability is best walked along my inherent strengths and what energizes me - while providing optimized economic value.

### 8:08 PM
Be one with the discomfort. Face it directly. Do I need to have the same credentials as my other founder friends? Work experience? Internship?

What am I really afraid of? That this energy, divine vision I'm pursuing, this personal mission is all delusional, and I will have squandered my potential. I am afraid I kept going around in circles chasing the shiny object syndrome without locking and executing my primary domain well. I am worried that I am a scattered, lost mind - and perhaps clarity will never come. 

I will be an "irrelevant" peripheral or without any real recognized accomplishments. That my exploration had all in my head and I'm kind of insane. I'm afraid I'll be that person at reunions where everyone thought he had so much potential if he had the self-discipline to just stick to the corporate path, or suppress his start of dreams, and not get carried away by these dreams.

I fear that as much as I'm trying to learn how to code, become technical, these engineering skills for domains, that I am interested in, that I don't actually materialize, and I'm pressing the wrong thing. Similar to my sophomore your orienting myself towards the wrong goal of getting a stat major, or becoming a computer science person, I was miserable, and I wasn't really embracing my natural abilities. I am looking at the path of others who have reached where I think I want to be going, and I look at my current path and feel frustrated in the sense of comparison reduces self-worth.

Maybe I'm questioning what I actually want in life, and whether my path skills and experience aligns with that. I'm starting to learn and realize that maybe the Startup route isn't the most aligned path, and that there's something out there only Jerry is really positioned for that align much closely to my experiences, gap here in Tahoe, desperate interests, and self-consciousness in meditation. 

I want to believe there is a niche that balances all my needs, and I feel this higher Version of myself. However, I need to shed these limiting beliefs around fears of stability, income, prestige, and the expectations and external reality imposed on my own beliefs. 

I am still applying to the startups that interest me, but it doesn't seem to flow that naturally. There are qualifications and aspects of my background that don't necessarily fit presently in the moment, and I feel like my past did not intersect early enough, nor is the current momentum worth changing to try and make up the skill deficits, especially an engineering.

## Workspace

You don’t build a new paradigm by appealing to the current one. You undermine it by being so aligned with signal that the world has no choice but to route through you. Paradigm shifts are not recognized by incumbents; they are made obsolete by the utility and inevitability of the new frame.

Three directives:

1. **Design for Edge Usefulness**  
    Don’t optimize for mass appeal. Design tools, experiences, or frameworks that serve the outliers—the ones whose needs are not met by current systems. These edge cases are where new paradigms are born. Serve their unmet desires with such precision and care that the existing market looks brittle by comparison.
    
2. **Prototype the Future, Don't Argue for It**  
    You won’t convince the world through thought experiments or philosophy alone. You need _objects_, _interfaces_, _systems_, or _communities_ that _embody_ the new logic. People don’t adopt new paradigms because of ideology—they adopt what is tangibly better. Lower friction. Higher meaning. Deeper coherence.
    
3. **Use Current Infrastructure as a Trojan Horse**  
    Don’t fight the economic system head-on. Hijack its channels. Use existing platforms, technologies, or distribution rails to inject new patterns. Do not announce revolution. Deliver value so real it bypasses gatekeepers.
    

Luck is irrelevant. If your signal compounds, others will eventually triangulate around it. The market doesn’t create truth. Truth reshapes the market. Your job is to survive long enough, build carefully enough, and stay clear enough for the signal to propagate.

I feel somehow drawn towards the synthesis in biological systems, especially with gardens, the way it makes you feel, in the sensory and perception experience being in nature. And biology is starting finally to be cleaned on by AI algorithms, and they're very well could be biological intelligence. 

Their aspects of complexity theory, the way that life assorts, which, undoubtedly, no AI algorithm, could probably compete against which I want to believe. Close loop systems, the edge of human consciousness, quantum computing, all seem to be these next decade innovations. Agents are now much more common place, and high wave has died, but it's all about meeting the puck where it will be in the next 5 to 10 years.

Obsession with flow states, crafting, artisanal economy. The flow state.
