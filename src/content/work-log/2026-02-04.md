# memo
I feel exhausted right now. Had to stay up. Yesterday until 11:30, 12. Helping Laura with her forehand, but thankfully we got that fixed. 
I woke up this morning, got 8 hours, but I just overall feel tired. The recovery optimization is something I need to work on. 
Even doing the morning start routine is a bit hard. 

There's always the question of what happens if I just chilled out this morning. What happens if I just let go and not worried about strictly starting. Usually it then goes to the Instagram algorithm, but I realized that 

I keep pushing robotics as the primary focus and goal, but that pressure seems to be causing exhaustion. If my identity was more fluid, and I could identify more as an athlete, someone who wants to be physically well first, getting up in the mornings would feel more aligned. 

I'm not sure if I'm getting the same spark or the same driving force. I know I need to do hard things, and disciplining myself over and over again, and pushing hard things in the morning is one way, but it does drain you time and time again.
