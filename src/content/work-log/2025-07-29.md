## Meditations

### 8:43 AM

Need to target larger engineering culture firms if I want "engineering experience". I dont necessarily want to be a pure engineer - I want a hybrid role which allows me to work with engineers and sales.

I think I might be more of an operations person, fundamentally. I possess the interpersonal skills, management and interest in engineering/technical. I am the "golden hybrid" which doesn't cleanly fit in a primarily engineering, sales role.

Actually, client facing engineering roles appeal to me more. I love the client facing aspect, along with developing engineering/solutions.

Insurance is unsexy, but massive market need. Sales skills are essential once you're upper management. Helps you build greater network, security and valuable relationships.

Building venture-backed startups requires many sacrifices. Some of these problems they are solving are out of touch with real problems affecting real people. Aside from NVIDIA and large hardware, deeptech - alot of the AI startups, especially in consumer world are grifty and aren't making a real impact/solving a tangible problem.

I hope to learn FDE (forward deployed engineering) with a converging domain expertise on real estate, agtech, industrials and supply chain. AWS, Kubernetes, etc... with an integration in robotics.

Detach from the academic, PhD identity, obsession with only neuroengineering, etc... focus on the current moment and current needs. The opportunities presented in front becomes the way.

---

Honestly, the route for me might be large tech company, DevOps or solutions consultant etc, build a stable base, drop back into startups or passion areas

## Workspace

[Future of robotics + Cloud Computing]([https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/future-of-robotics-cloud-computing](https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/future-of-robotics-cloud-computing))

Gaining a deeper understanding of this sector, and apply towards AI safety/responsibility.

Cutting Edge Innovations in Robotics:

- Edge AI: Bringing AI capabilities closer to the robots to reduce latency and improve real-time decision-making.

- 5G Networks: Utilizing 5G networks for faster and more reliable communication between robots and the cloud.
- Swarm Robotics: Coordinating large numbers of robots to achieve complex tasks.

FogROS 2 is an open-source cloud-robotics pilot platform from UC Berkeley. Cloud computing using commercial clusters such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) - [See Documentation]([https://berkeleyautomation.github.io/FogROS2/about](https://berkeleyautomation.github.io/FogROS2/about))

> These applications are more aligned with emodied robot movements and articulation

Integrates with [ORB-SLAM]([https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2)) and [motion planning templates]([https://robotics.cs.unc.edu/mpt/](https://robotics.cs.unc.edu/mpt/))
