## Meditations


### 5:30 AM
Best time of day, peace and quiet. Darkness outside as I move forward on my quest. 

First time I've felt more clearheaded in the morning. Retention really does work, it clears your mind. 

Im going to do some yoga as well to activate and integrate my body and mind. 

### 7:40 PM
Find the obsessive edge for perfection. The mental state routine/playbook you can follow no matter the domain. Which grounds yourself in the present, and allows you to play the infinite game.

I need to find "flow state roles", which don't drain me but still can build up 1) network 2) skills. I don't want to pigeon hole myself

This should emerge. I shouldn't be trying to force this. I need to put feelers out early though. Doesn't need to be a startup per-se, but at least proximity to talent clusters and accessibility to career growth opportunities. 

These roles must blend mission/purpose, enough work-life balance. Or arbitrage something nobody else wants to do, which I am uniquely capable. Not sexy.
