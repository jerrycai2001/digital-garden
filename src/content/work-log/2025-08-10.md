## Meditations

### 2:02 PM
After today's lesson with mommy, I realized my asymmetric strength is teaching people, technical subjects, intuitively and connecting with adults. This is in line with Ricardo's observations and emphasis on moving to San Francisco, where people who can execute our preferred in selected for over credentials.

I was meditating as well, the importance of going with the flow, reducing the amount of friction and resistance. Detach yourself in the process, time box, and if it doesn't hit the mark, move on. The value of time-boxing cannot be overstated - it's incredibly effective at giving constraints to figure out an optimal solution. It also enables more trials to be run, and prevents unnecessary waste of time on something that doesn't move the needle in the end.

Focused, beats, grinding any day in the long run. lean into my strength, focus on the right things, execute and have these wins compound and battle aligned progress is what carries one forward. 

People are also attracted to calmness, confidence in the moment. That poise applies to all aspects of my life. Compassionate detachment enables you to honor your core values while not getting attached or distracted by circumstances out of your control.
