# memo

obj: focus on rejuvenation, introduce energy/aligned actions.
no "strictly execution" without alignment

felt sudden rush of energy @ 4:30 am, couldn't sleep for past 2 hours
created Palantir AIP, posted/replied on X, submitted a16z speedrun on a whim
but didn't feel 100% aligned - my soul wasn't really nourished
this all somehow felt so performative

however, the dilemma is monetizing authenticity is SO HARD
soul nourishing activities like writing, reading, fishing, music
