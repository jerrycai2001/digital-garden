 I have these moments of insight, but I need to structure them, learn to communicate and record them, so I can revisit and actually implement them.  One of my goals is to become a more structured communicator, thinker, and writer. I want to reduce the verbose - actually, I embrace my verbose nature, but in times of execution, I need to do it efficiently 

our objective is to find the blockers of mental clarity and obstacles in getting into the flow state 

Habits:
 I need to read over my past notes and extract insights for meaningful reflection 
 I need to increase the number of emails in total outreach and feel more fearless and bold as I reach out and meet people 
 need to maximize my surface area by posting on social media more and writing content 


Point 1: The Past - Mental resilience: facing adversity and moments of doubt in the present moment and moving forward
 I wake up facing demons every morning, but as soon as I get up and execute my morning routine, I grow stronger and can see and more clearly tackle them
 I also get caught up in mental trip ropes thinking about my past, dwelling on my doubt and insufficiency. Thinking about my failures and inability to finish an engineering degree along with other handicaps. I need to figure out a way to integrate these and be more resilient and ground myself to just start doing the harder thing at hand in the present moment

Point 2: The Future -  reconciling the unknown, legitimate concerns about job stability
I keep thinking about which jobs would work well for me, and there's points of uncertainty 
 information that I don't have about job prospects and future conditions stops me from executing in the present 
concerns about "adult tasks" like: Job security, Health insurance, Having a place to save enough money, Having that compound in wealth All of these are constraints 
also, the amount of debt that I've put myself in is what concerns me, and knowing that I have turned down other stable paths to keep on pursuing this dream. But I know deep down this is what really matters, and I'm thinking long-term in the future 
I also fear that the roles that I'm pursuing may not align with my skills, and if I need to go to grad school or not, I'm not sure 
 
Point 3: Present pain, fears of physical and mental constraints -  understanding my values and where my boundaries are 
 I don't want to push myself too hard and hit a point of depression 
 I know that what I'm working for, in the end of the day, is for stability, freedom, and the ability to work on something cool 
 I value intellectual learning and working on hard, complex, but intellectually stimulating problems.  I want to find a mentor who I can work with. The team and talent density is so high that I'm willing to lift my standards up
