Balancing "efficiency" and inherent pleasure

There is learning for efficiency, to accomplish the ends - and learning for sheer pleasure. Mental model is if I'm learning skills/concepts for direct job prospects or professional gain, I should take the most DIRECT, ESSENTIAL path. However if my primary purpose is learning for fun, pleasure - I can be more flexible. 

The question of doing something for its own joy or for purpose of economic value:
Is me learning more focused software development (CLI, GitHub, Deployments, etc...) because I genuinely enjoy learning and breaking down components of technology? Or is there an underlying intent of developing skills with economic value?

I'm conflicted because what I consider joy and fascination - learning robotics, reading computer vision papers, trying to understand advanced robotics concepts for fun - I am doing at my own pace, and not at the rigor of a university engineering program. However, this feels right and I feel fulfilled. 

My concern is I am pretending this is a passion or interest, when part of its appeal is relevant economic value. In my mind, if I were doing this learning for economic reasons, to more readily find a job in infrastructure engineering/cloud solutions, I'd be most efficient by taking courses or certifications. 

However, my interest in robotics - is the depth enough for me to build a career around and make that my primary skill and economic value proposition? Especially if I learn this on the side, will I develop the full competncy and work experience? 

I'd say its close to 80/90 for enjoyment, 10 for economic reasons motivating my self-learning. Compare that to 60/70 for this Masters in Analytics which is primarily for in-demand economic roles. The reason robotics is closer to my heart - I'm fascinated by perception, cognition, computation especially understanding human consciousness and our relationship to nature.

This feels more natural and aligned, and feels more channeled to my inner being. The issue is that robotics is very interdisciplinary, so I must create structure on learning aspects of the field.
