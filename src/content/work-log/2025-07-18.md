## Meditations

### 6:47 AM
Balancing "efficiency" and inherent pleasure

There is learning for efficiency, to accomplish the ends - and learning for sheer pleasure. Mental model is if I'm learning skills/concepts for direct job prospects or professional gain, I should take the most DIRECT, ESSENTIAL path. However if my primary purpose is learning for fun, pleasure - I can be more flexible. 

The question of doing something for its own joy or for purpose of economic value:
Is me learning more focused software development (CLI, GitHub, Deployments, etc...) because I genuinely enjoy learning and breaking down components of technology? Or is there an underlying intent of developing skills with economic value?

I'm conflicted because what I consider joy and fascination - learning robotics, reading computer vision papers, trying to understand advanced robotics concepts for fun - I am doing at my own pace, and not at the rigor of a university engineering program. However, this feels right and I feel fulfilled. 

My concern is I am pretending this is a passion or interest, when part of its appeal is relevant economic value. In my mind, if I were doing this learning for economic reasons, to more readily find a job in infrastructure engineering/cloud solutions, I'd be most efficient by taking courses or certifications. 

However, my interest in robotics - is the depth enough for me to build a career around and make that my primary skill and economic value proposition? Especially if I learn this on the side, will I develop the full competncy and work experience? 

I'd say its close to 80/90 for enjoyment, 10 for economic reasons motivating my self-learning. Compare that to 60/70 for this Masters in Analytics which is primarily for in-demand economic roles. The reason robotics is closer to my heart - I'm fascinated by perception, cognition, computation especially understanding human consciousness and our relationship to nature.

This feels more natural and aligned, and feels more channeled to my inner being. The issue is that robotics is very interdisciplinary, so I must create structure on learning aspects of the field.


### 7:56 PM
What actually fascinates me about robotics? Its the cognition and embodiment of consciousness. This is similar to understanding tennis flow state, neuroscience and meditation. 

By extension, its this greater biodynamic connection with nature, life and higher consciousness. Embodied systems architect. I am a systems architect, in computational 

**Strategic Direction:** Look for roles in:

- Human-AI interaction design
- Ethical system design in robotics
- Embodied cognition research
- Nature-integrated tech (biofabrication, soft robotics)
- Tools for resilient, local systems (agritech, climate adaptation)


### 9:33 PM
Took a walk around the neighborhood. Movement re-energizes, especially during post-work, post-dinner stupor. 

I saw Ryan Gosling talk about acting - how everyone in LA left their families, friends, security to pursue the Hollywood dream. 

```
"Was this delusion or premoition? There was only one way to find out"
```


I went back on LinkedIn and immediately got off. The kind of content is just brain-rot. 

I started sharpening my sushi knife - there is something so beautiful, connected about sharpening a knife. The kinesthetic aspect, feeling, sensing a product being shaped. Same thread with food.

I asked myself while walking, what makes us essentially human? The "human-ness" of tradition, culture infused in artisanal craftsmanship. Food, knifemaking, especially tools which have a physical component fully capture this phenomena. 

Perhaps the paradigm for me isn't analysis and disecting the exact fundamental mechanisms of being human, such as robotics perhaps is doing. Robotics and tech seem to be fundamentally trying to emulate and recreate something fundamentally human. But rather fully embodying this, living in the moment and just BEING - sharpen knives, cook food, do all of the activities deeply that engage you into a meditative zen state which enriches your peak output. 

Maybe the craving and desire in me isn't specifically robotics - but anything physical: architecture, ecosystem, biodynamics, chemical/materials design - engineering, which funnily revisits my roots as a kid in building legos and just messing around in the kitchen or wandering in the woods. 

This is probably the most heightened and connected I've felt all day. 

## Workspace

#### 3. **You're ideal for field systems roles.**

Field engineer at a hardtech startup isn’t just about tightening bolts. It’s applied thinking, coordination, feedback-looping real-world systems, embodying product-market fit in the wild.

But you don’t need the job title “engineer” to do this.

Roles that fit your profile:
- **Deployment Strategist (Palantir-type field roles)**
- **Solutions Engineer or Integrations Engineer at hardware/biotech startups**
- **Field Applications Scientist (biotech tools)**
- **Product Operations / Technical PM at early-stage hardtech**
- **Technical Pre-Sales or Solutions Consultant in robotics or sensing tech**
- **R&D Ops or Prototype Integrator in mission-driven startups**

These roles let you:
- Interface with engineering without having to code firmware
- Own outcomes, not internal politics
- Iterate between design, sensing, and real-world complexity
