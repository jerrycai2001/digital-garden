Grifting is so common place now in scams have become the norm. It's what Richard justifies as "this is how the real world works". It's deeply morally troubling to see a lack of regard for greater care, acting in good faith for other human beings, instead replaced by obsession for one's self enrichment. It's the ego manifesting itself to an extreme.

However, I question my own moral compass. If actions which are considered "grifting "or just how the indifferent universe works, am I being too sensitive or am I unnecessarily causing self harm? Is a lion killing a giselle, and letting it suffer, and die a slow death in the same moral transgression in the same category as cheating, grifting in startups? It's just a fact of nature, and those who are naturally selected to best execute are the ones who win, especially in a competition environment.

It almost feels that integrity, the morals of spouse by Judea Christian beliefs, are some sort of delusion. Unless, if the almost 5000 years of human history, culture in allegories and literature, with archetypes, passing down age, old wisdom about people who grift and the outcome - completely false.

I am hesitant to jump back into the startup world, given the incentives to readily game. The system, play a zero sum game, in execute a real politic, like approach with little regard to ideals or morals. And I am not a saint or an extreme spiritual leader in any regards. I am willing to take into practical consideration and adjust my behaviors in orientation. 

I don't know if this is my youthful naivety, influencing my outlook, but something deep down feels wrong, and in authentic about engaging in grifting, system gaming for an end that I don't truly believe in, nor do I want to see an ideal version of the world. My mind, and rational conditioning tells me one direction, but my heart and soul points me in another orthogonal direction. I don't believe in absolute opposites, I believe there are higher dimensions, which both are orthogonal and reveal across like normal vector that integrates both component vectors.
