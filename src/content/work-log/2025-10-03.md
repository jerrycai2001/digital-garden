we will conserve our energy and focus on high signal, high roi tasks. be present and energized. don't feel pressured into building tech or other non-core tasks. 

re-energize around people who are on same human-centric tech.

i've spent almost 3 hours trying to troubleshoot this part of the Foundry coding interface. 

I thought I could build a POC pretty quickly, but I seem to keep getting tripped up. I'm just concerned about more advanced modules its going to be harder.

it feels the same way i felt in CIS110, where I'm hitting massive resistance when trying to code. the harder i push and strive for it, the harder and more i struggle. i know challenges are supposed to be difficult but rewarding, but it feels like some people are just naturally pick this up faster. 

it felt this way the first time i interviewed - i focused, poured all of my time and effort into building, but i was struggling on the fundamental modules and file directory/naming while possibly other applicants moved through faster. 

i'm questioning whether i'm cut out for this, as I'm thinking about my natural stregnths. however, i love technology and want to improve and learn more, but this frustrating roadblock is showing some of my limitations and how i think/approach problems. its not the same creative flow

There's gotta be a way to see the branch structure of a claude conversation. especially during coding, buildings with hierarchies, getting into the weeds, and zooming back out to see the bigger picture, the dialectic dialogue, which is linear fails to show this hierarchy.

Are there any AI tools or startup that integrate with Claude to give you a more visual interface when working on more complex systems?

The reasoning is that insights pop up randomlt certain cohesively structure the information. I want to be able to maintain my train of thought for the primary planned task.

Quick update on the situation. So I'm now in the process of volunteer for employment strategies position in New York, I was connected with my parents to an older forward deployed engineer.

Basically counter just closed contract with Lumen, formally CenturyLink.

Right off the bat, this isn't a San Francisco position, but if I stay with long enough on a project within a few months, I should have flexibility within the firm to live in San Francisco. This is appealing because I already went through pretty far with the process so I know generally how to use their platform AIP.

I'm also interested in the telecommunications aspect because of sensor data work.

I'm trying to get a better sense of what the actual work will entail because this is what the friend told me:

Yea for sure, lmk if you want to call to learn more but the for the telco project I'm specifically hiring for (since it's my team and we are short people lol) we're looking for echos and deltas to work across a bunch of different use cases. It just recently became the largest deal in palantir history so u can imagine we have use cases across the company from device decommissioning, finance, infrastructure, etc. I cant say for sure which exact team youd be joining but biggest commonality for echos/deltas here is probably being good at tying disparate systems together - our main goal is to main Foundry the platform for them and that could mean simplifying 100+ in-house/existing 3rd party platforms they currently use to just Foundry

The sound of it, it's a digital transformation, and AI transformation for a large telecom. I'd be streamlining operations in certain workflows.

I'm trying to do diligence into what are the actual pain points they're solving, what exactly are these fragmented workflows and how do I devise the solution using and the AIP platform?

Could you help me look into this research on how this would look like, I looked at some McKinsey reports - but what I really need is schema from live data or realistic data they would be working with.

I want to demonstrate fluency with foundry and possibly build a tool that helps streamline refactoring data schema across different siloed workflows.

Could you give me some information and a rough outline here?
