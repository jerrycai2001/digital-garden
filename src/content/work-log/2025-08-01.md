## Meditations

### 10:09 AM

Started my day off right - meditated for 30 minutes. Set the frame of reference correct.

Embodied robotics, flow states.

Is the embodied AI, robotics experience similar to that of humans? Especially when inputs are raw sensory encoding for movements, we would theoretically need greater scale of compute right?

Robots can be deployed on a greater scale, while optimally strategizing actions - for better or wose with humans.

Black swan event with NVIDIA robotics.

Can robotics learn to beat a human in tennis, 100 times out of 100? How would you theoretically build a robot who can beat a human in tennis

Install tkinter first so python mounts correctly

> brew install python-tk@3.11 

 this is the pain of using open source, robotics on python. I keep on having these version, independency issues, especially with having to reinstall pip versus brew, worrying about the architecture of my operating system (arm64 vs x86), and the cascading number of modules independencies running from trimesh, igl, tkinter.... the list goes on. 

I need to figure out how Docker works so we can just have a deployable version that is containerized.
