## Meditations

### 10:00 AM
I woke up today feeling exhausted again. Not sure if this is because of missing a day or two of my medication's or an increased hedonistic scrolling on my electronic devices. I want to keep my phone off as much as I can, and be more intentional about the applications I use.

I was debating between going to the Buddhist Zen Temple versus going ahead and getting my tasks done. I realized my philosophy is more integrative, and not exactly Zen dogmatically. I decided the nonnegotiable for me, was meditating twice each day, and morning meditation and yoga in the backyard. I felt more present, and connected with nature, and grounded in my thoughts along with my body. 

This brought about the replenishment and rejuvenation I earned for the past couple of days. And in line with the consistency and long-term compounding principal, doing this every day, and taking the small steps forward will reap benefits in the long run, in the present execution is more repeatable as the days go by.

I noticed there was tension and hesitation, going back-and-forth and indecision about what I should be doing with my Sundays - should I optimize for values alignment, such as meditating, more, and doing Zen, or more immediate utilitarian and materialistic pursuits, such as optimizing my career skills. There wasn't a answer, and I ended up choosing a more balanced middle path, which allows for both to be catered to.

I observed my thoughts from this morning and saw more often than usual this client in desiring and grabbing for some level of certainty. Uncertainty about my path right now pertaining to robotics and more mission, aligned work, along with my social relationships and maintaining amazing friendships I have cultivated from school. I also think about the moment, where either I could be diving deeper into AWS, and learning about cloud solutions that are more economically, salient, and relevant, or following my passions, in regenerative food solutions, nature and building biodynamic structures. 

I guess there isn't one answer, and overtime the dynamics will shape themselves. 

Fundamentally, I won't push myself too hard today because I've already taxed my energy this week especially during work. I will let the robotics emerge and fill the time that I've allotted, but I will prioritize going outside to enjoy the beautiful weather, a reprieve from the humid, monsoon like weathers - and go fly fishing at the Eno river and just build that skill which I feel brings me so much joy. Also, hope to go to [Open Eye Caf√©](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FFqKJKUgHZnTrUVo6), and just be present amongst a cool community.
