# writing

recently feeling tired, depleted. slogging through work and needing more rest/recovery
fishing - althought physically demanding - fulfilled the deepest part of my soul
- became a 3rd person observer to my irrational decision-making, inner demons
- understood a primal, suppressed version which guides everyday decisions
- more consciously embodied detachment from outcomes

deeper relationship with food, high quality ingredients
branched out intellectual fascination with applied probability/signal processing, linguistics (language family tree), history of united states, us consumerism

fishing drives startup/business insights in finding pmf or optimizing for your strengths
fishing's behavioral economics + relationship to poker

ultimate synthesis: what goals have changed? what habits, or new directions will i implement?
- fishing twice a month - flexible date wise, as stress/disconnect from intense entrepreneurship thoughts + tasks
- invest further in relationships ALIGNED with personal values - values-based orientation pays the most dividends in the long run for life. 
- write, create and educate - synthesize fishing, tennis, yoga - Jerry's key differentators and non-fungibility into all walks of life. this generates aligned signal.
