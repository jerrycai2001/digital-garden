You are building an AI-powered insurance agent productivity platform called "InsureAI" - think of it as a combination of HubSpot CRM + AI assistant specifically for independent insurance agents.

CORE REQUIREMENTS:
1. **Email Management Hub**: Gmail/Outlook integration with AI-powered email classification, auto-responses, and lead extraction
2. **Customer Service AI**: Chatbot that can answer policy questions, schedule appointments, and route complex queries
3. **Policy Administration**: Simple CRUD for policies, renewals, quotes with AI-generated follow-ups
4. **Integration Center**: Easy connections to Trello (task management), Airtable (data storage), and insurance tools

TECH STACK:
- Frontend: Next.js 14 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components
- Backend: Node.js/Express with TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- AI: OpenAI GPT-4 integration
- Real-time: Socket.io for live updates
- Auth: NextAuth.js with email/password

MVP FEATURES TO BUILD:
1. **Dashboard**: Key metrics, AI insights, priority tasks, recent activity
2. **Email Interface**: Inbox view with AI categorization (leads, renewals, claims, general)
3. **Client Management**: Simple CRM with contact info, policies, and AI-suggested actions
4. **AI Chat Assistant**: Floating chat widget that helps with daily tasks
5. **Integration Settings**: OAuth flows for Gmail, Trello, Airtable
6. **Policy Pipeline**: Visual pipeline for quotes → binding → renewal

SPECIFIC FEATURES:
- AI email classification: Automatically tag emails as "Hot Lead", "Renewal Due", "Claim", "General Inquiry"
- Smart notifications: AI determines which emails/tasks need immediate attention
- Auto-draft responses: AI suggests email replies based on context
- Lead scoring: AI analyzes email content to score lead quality
- Renewal alerts: Automated reminders 90/60/30 days before policy expiration
- Cross-sell suggestions: AI identifies upsell opportunities based on client data

INTEGRATIONS TO IMPLEMENT:
1. **Gmail API**: Read emails, send emails, create drafts
2. **Trello API**: Create cards for tasks, move cards through pipeline
3. **Airtable API**: Sync client data, policy information
4. **Webhook system**: Generic webhook receiver for other insurance tools

UI/UX REQUIREMENTS:
- Clean, professional design similar to Linear or Notion
- Mobile-responsive
- Dark/light mode toggle
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Drag-and-drop task management
- Real-time notifications

DATABASE SCHEMA:
- Users (agents)
- Clients (contact info, company details)
- Policies (type, status, premium, renewal dates)
- Emails (parsed content, AI classifications, sentiment)
- Tasks (AI-generated and manual)
- Integrations (OAuth tokens, settings)

Start by creating the project structure, then build the core dashboard with mock data. Focus on making it look professional and include placeholder AI responses that simulate real functionality. Make sure to include proper TypeScript types and component organization.

Build this as a production-ready MVP that could be deployed and demoed to insurance agents immediately.
